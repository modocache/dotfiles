# Git configuration
# =================
#
# To use this configuration, I symlink it to my home directory:
# ```
# ln -s (pwd)/.gitconfig  ~/.gitconfig
# ```
[user]
  name = Brian Gesiak
  email = brian@modocache.io

[core]
  # In cases where Git opens a text editor (such as for an interactive rebase
  # with `git rebase -i`), have it open Vim.
  editor = vim
  # To ignore certain files across this entire host, I create a file at this
  # path and fill it with paths (relative to a Git repository root) to ignore.
  # To get started, I copy the `.gitignore` from this repository:
  # ```
  # mkdir -p ~/.config/git; and cp (pwd)/.gitignore ~/.config/git/
  # ```
  excludesfile = ~/.config/git/.gitignore

[grep]
  # Run every `git grep` as if `-n` or `--line-number` were specified (i.e. the
  # line number of each match appears after the filename).
  lineNumber = true

[include]
  # Git supports including other files.
  # For any host-specific settings, I create a file at this path and fill it
  # with settings like the ones in this file. Settings may also be overridden,
  # so I can choose to use a different `user.email` setting on each machine,
  # for example.

[includeIf "gitdir:llvm-project/"]
  # Git also supports conditional includes: the following file is only read
  # within a repository named `llvm-project`.
